                <h1>A little bit about me<br /></h1>
                <p>I graduated in May 2024 with a Bachelor of Data Analytics from Western Kentucky University. During my time at WKU, I was a tutor at the Kelly Autism Program, worked at the CHNGES environmental science lab, and spent a year with the nonprofit Bike4Alz. As part of Bike4Alz, I biked across the United States with a team of 14, raising over $150,000 for Alzheimer's research. These experiences developed my skills in teaching, data analytics, and teamwork.

                    In my free time, I teach English to local refugees, helping them integrate into the community and improve their language skills. I am also individually finishing the development of the Live Data Dashboard, which is linked in the projects area of this website. In February, my mentor helped me apply for two grants (Faculty Undergraduate and U.S. Data Science), which have significantly supported the completion of this project. I am passionate about using data to solve complex problems and am committed to making a positive impact through community service and volunteer work.</p>
