						<h3>Developing a Comprehensive Dashboard for the Ames, Iowa Housing Market<br /></h3>
						<!-- Word Document Link -->
                        <p><a href="https://github.com/jackgalloway44/jackgalloway.github.io/raw/main/Final_Project_Galloway.docx" target="_blank">Download my Word document here</a></p>						
						<p>This project involves the creation of an advanced dashboard utilizing Tableau and R to analyze historical housing data in Ames, Iowa. The primary aim is to provide insights into the housing market and guide investment decisions for maximizing profit from flipping homes.</p>

						<div class="image main"><img src="images/tab.png" alt="Tableau Analysis" /></div>
						
						<p>To achieve this, I focused on two main questions: What types of homes are currently selling in Ames, Iowa? And, what homes are selling at higher prices? These questions guided the design and selection of visualizations for the dashboard.</p>

						<p>In designing the dashboard, I adhered to key principles from the Information Dashboard Design (IDD) book. The dashboard was kept simple, with a primary blue color scheme. Complementary colors like orange and green were used selectively to highlight crucial information, ensuring clarity and focus.</p>
						
						<p>Additionally, we created graphs in R to compare them to the results in Tableau, ensuring a robust analysis and validation of our findings.</p>

						<p>Under the “Predicting Sales Price” section of my dashboard, I included square footage, year built, and garage type, all of which showed a correlation to sale price during the research stage of this project. Square footage showed the strongest correlation, with an increase in $104 per square foot. Next year built also showed a strong correlation, with an increase in $1375 per yearly increase on date built. Finally, we saw that with garage type, built in and attached garage sold at the highest prices.</p>
						
						<p>When looking at the types of homes that were sold, we can see that the majority of homes sold didn’t have a fence, were a 1-family building style, and majority had an attached garage type.</p>
						
						<p>What can we take away from this? I would recommend to my boss to always try to buy newer homes, as they sell for higher. I would also recommend buying mostly 1-family homes, as these are the majority of homes sold. Once the home is bought, I would recommend building an attached garage if there isn’t already one, because we can see from the dashboard that they are in high demand. I would also recommend that during the renovation process, they definitely should consider increasing the square footage whenever possible, as this will increase the home value significantly.</p>
